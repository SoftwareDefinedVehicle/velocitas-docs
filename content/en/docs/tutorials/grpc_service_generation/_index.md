  Learn how to generate and fill your own gRPC services.

This tutorial shows how to generate a basic gRPC service like a seat service. For this example the proto file at <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-incubation/0.4.0/seat_service/proto/sdv/edge/comfort/seats/v1/seats.proto> is used.

All files included from `services/seats` are auto-generated and added to the app project as Conan dependency.
For writing a complete gRPC service you need two velocitas apps/projects.
One is implementing a client and the other one is for providing the server.

## Networking

The examples shown in this tutorial are based on three components running:

* A client using the API defined in the proto file
* A server providing the API and communicating with Databroker to read or modify datapoints
* A [Kuksa Databroker](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker).

As a Velocitas developer you may use the [Velocitas devenv-runtimes](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/devenv-runtimes) to deploy and run the Databroker instance, but it is also possible to connect to a Databroker running on localhost.
The setup used for the examples have been as followed:

* One Velocitas Devcontainer running the Client, based on the [Vehicle App C++ Template](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-cpp-template).
* One Velocitas Devcontainer running the Server, based on the [Vehicle App C++ Template](https://github.com/eclipse-velocitas/vehicle-app-cpp-template).
* Databroker running on localhost.

For this to work the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` were changed. In the setup `--network=host` were added to allow the containers
to use the host network, and for the server `forwardPorts": [ 5555 ]` were used to forward port 5555.

```
    "forwardPorts": [ 5555 ],
	"runArgs": [
		"--init",
		"--privileged",
		"--cap-add=SYS_PTRACE",
		"--network=host",
		"--security-opt",
		"seccomp=unconfined"
	],
```

Note that changes to `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` may be overwritten when `velocitas sync`is performed.

## Running the examples

To run the examples the following actions needs to be performed in the following order:

* Databroker needs to be started. 
  If using a Databroker on host make sure that it is compatible with the Velocitas version you are using.
  The catalog used must also be compatible with the signals used in the example
* With a Databroker Client ([Kuksa Python Client](https://pypi.org/project/kuksa-client/) or [Databroker CLI](https://github.com/eclipse-kuksa/kuksa-databroker)) set the current value of `Vehicle.Cabin.Seat.Row1.DriverSide.Position` to a valid value, for example 12.
* Start the server
* Start the client
* Verify that no (unexpected) errors are reported
* Using the Databroker Client, verify that the target value of `Vehicle.Cabin.Seat.Row1.DriverSide.Position` has been set to 75.
