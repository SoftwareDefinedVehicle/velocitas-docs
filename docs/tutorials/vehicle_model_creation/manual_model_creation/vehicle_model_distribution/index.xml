      <description>Now that you have created your own Vehicle Model, we can distribute it to make use of it in Vehicle Apps.&#xA;Copying the folder to your Vehicle App repo The easiest way to get started quickly is to copy the created model, presumably stored in vehicle_model into your Vehicle App repository to use it. To do so, simply copy and paste the directory into the &amp;lt;sdk_root&amp;gt;/app directory and replace the existing model.</description>

      <description>Now you a have a Python package containing your first Python Vehicle Model and it is time to distribute it. There is nothing special about the distribution of this package, since it is just an ordinary Python package. Check out the Python Packaging User Guide to learn more about packaging and package distribution in Python.&#xA;Distribute to single Vehicle App If you want to distribute your Python Vehicle Model to a single Vehicle App, you can do so by copying the entire folder my_vehicle_model under the /app/src folder of your Vehicle App repository and treat it as a sub-package of the Vehicle App.</description>
